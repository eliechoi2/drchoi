          <p> Dr. Choi was born and raised in Montgomery County, Maryland. He attended the University of Maryland, Baltimore County and received his Doctor of Dental Surgery degree from the University of Maryland, Baltimore College of Dental Surgery in 2000. Dr. Choi worked as a dental laboratory technician for 4 years prior to attending dental school. This acquired training allows him to have a superior understanding behind dental prosthetics.
            <br>
            <br>
            After working at other large practices, Dr. Choi has seen the advantages and quality of services that can be provided by keeping it a single doctor practice. He has been practicing at the current location ever since and has developed long term multi-generational relationships with his patients. The years being in practice has allowed him to find the top specialists in the field to provide a comprehensive care team to his patients. The goal is to avoid providing “assembly-line” care that is common for large, high volume dental practices out there.
            <br>
            <br>
            Weekly meetings with referring specialists and regular continuing education seminars and meetings allows him to maintain the most current dental care available.</p>
